# Finite Volume Practice
This repo. has some notebooks and scripts that show my trying to learn finite volume methods in summer 2020.  

For sources - I like the discussion in [1] especially in terms of introducing all the material, but I find the notation gets a little crazy... so I ended up using [2] a little more as a reference when I was actually trying to implement any of the procedures.  The same author also has lots of papers that go into more detail than I could ever want into some of the technical aspects.
